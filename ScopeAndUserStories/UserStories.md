### User story of Luna
As an eco-friendly, non-waste believer, I want to have the opportunity to buy an ecological soap where I can be in charge of picking my own ingredients, including essential oil scents, so that the soap can match my skin-type and/or hair. I also want to read reviews to base my decisions on.

### User story of Dries
As a health-conscious man who likes to take care of his hair and body with something else than the convential "3-in-1" shampoo, I would want to customize my soap bars to my own taste and needs.
