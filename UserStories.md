### User story of Luna
As an eco-friendly, non-waste believer, I want to have the opportunity to buy an ecological soap where I can be in charge of picking my own ingredients, including essential oil scents, so that the soap can match my skin-type and/or hair.

### User story of Ruth
As an environmentally conscious mother of two kids, I want to make my own ecological soap without losing precious time that I could spend with my kids. So I need an online store that allow me to customize and order my own soaps from the comfort of home.

### User story of Dries
As a health-conscious man who likes to take care of his hair and body with something else than the convential "3-in-1" shampoo, I would want to customize my soap bars to my own taste and needs.
